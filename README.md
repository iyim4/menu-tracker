### Overview
The web scraping program collects data from UT Austin Dining Hall online menus and stores it into an online database. The web app allows the user to search the database for a food and filter results by type (Date, Mealtime, Location). 

### Motivation
I would often miss the times when my favorite food, brisket, was served at the dining hall. This project was created so that Iâ€™ll never miss it again!
